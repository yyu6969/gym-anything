# Environment Creation Workflow for gym_anything — macOS targets

You are creating a new **macOS environment** for gym-anything. macOS envs
run on remote Mac sandboxes via the use.computer fleet (not QEMU/Apptainer
like the Linux envs). This prompt is shorter than the Linux one (`prompt.md`)
because it defers to a single comprehensive reference and two working
example envs you should mirror.

## Optional AAB context

The invocation prompt may include an explicit `## Input` block. When present,
treat each labeled value according to its own contract:

- **Software** identifies the application being reconstructed.
- **Environment Specification** defines the stable shared world. Use it for
  application configuration, persistent entities and data, relationships,
  permissions, and required capabilities.
- **Environment Initial State** defines per-task state. Implement
  `task_preconditions` in the task's existing `pre_task` setup/reset hook,
  and use `episode_start` to prepare the initial application, page,
  authenticated session, and visible UI.
- **Task Instruction** is the exact benchmark task. Preserve its wording and
  intent in the generated `task.json` description and support it rather than
  inventing an unrelated task.

Never turn mutable task preconditions into permanent environment configuration,
and never merge the three AAB artifacts into undifferentiated context. If no AAB
context is supplied, follow the legacy task-generation workflow unchanged.

## Phase 0: REQUIRED reading order (do this FIRST)

Read these files end-to-end, in this order, before writing a single line of
code. Every macOS-specific gotcha that has been encountered so far is in
them. Reading them up front is much cheaper than re-discovering the same
issues.

1. **`extras/research/software_as_env/creation_audit/memory/env_creation_notes/12_macos_environments.md`** —
   complete guide: UseComputerRunner architecture, `/Users/lume/workspace`
   path (macOS root is read-only under SIP), install patterns (DMG → .app,
   DMG → .pkg, brew cask), Rosetta requirement for x86 apps, the pre_task
   convention, AppleScript-over-SSH TCC trap, VNC URL handling, no checkpoint
   caching, the `Enter` ≠ `Return` keyboard gotcha, Cmd+Space (Spotlight)
   doesn't work, Safari is sandboxed (real prefs in `~/Library/Containers/...`).

2. **`extras/research/software_as_env/creation_audit/memory/env_creation_notes/10_cross_cutting_patterns.md`** —
   37 general patterns including #35 (verify-against-user-flow), #36
   (follow-prior-conventions), #37 (probe-before-speculating). Don't skim;
   these are mandatory.

3. **`extras/research/software_as_env/creation_audit/memory/env_creation_notes/06_env_creation_checklist.md`** —
   the per-env checklist. Note its "If macOS app" branch.

4. **`extras/research/software_as_env/creation_audit/memory/env_creation_notes/specific_env_notes/safari/`** —
   per-env notes for the existing Safari env. Reference for prefs handling,
   plist/SQLite verifier paths, real-world quirks.

5. **`extras/research/software_as_env/creation_audit/memory/env_creation_notes/specific_env_notes/google_earth_macos/notes.md`** —
   the other built-out macOS env (Google Earth Pro). Reference for install
   pattern (DMG → .pkg, Rosetta) and per-task evidence shape.

6. **`benchmarks/cua_world-macos/environments/safari_env/`** — the reference
   *implementation*. Read every file (`env.json`, `scripts/install_*.sh`,
   `scripts/setup_*.sh`, `tasks/<task>/task.json`, `setup_task.sh`,
   `export_result.sh`, `verifier.py`, `test_verifier_offline.py`,
   `collect_evidence.py`). Copy the shape; adapt for your target app.

7. **`benchmarks/cua_world-macos/environments/safari_env/evidence_docs/devtools_security_header_audit/README.md`** —
   complete example of what the evidence package should contain (4 flows:
   probe_prefs, do_nothing, wrong_target, happy_path, interactive_pilot).

8. **`extras/research/task_generation/propose_and_amplify/memory/task_creation_notes/`** —
   task-creation principles (real data, ≥3 verification criteria, baseline
   recording, wrong-target rejection, anti-gaming strategy enumeration,
   offline mock tests required). Same standard as Linux envs apply.

---

## Phase 1: Key constraints specific to macOS

After reading the references above, internalize these constraints — they
shape every decision:

- **Runner is `UseComputerRunner`** (not QEMU, not Docker). Set
  `"runner": "use_computer"` and `"base": "macos"` in env.json.
- **Workspace path is `/Users/lume/workspace`**, not `/workspace`. macOS root
  is read-only under SIP. All `mounts[*].target` and hook paths must use
  `/Users/lume/workspace/...`.
- **User is `lume`**, not `ga`. Passwordless sudo is configured. Don't write
  `su - ga -c "..."`.
- **No DISPLAY env var, no xdotool, no scrot.** Use the use.computer SDK's
  `mac.mouse` / `mac.keyboard` / `mac.screenshot` via the runner, or
  `screencapture -x` for command-line shots.
- **`diagnostics: true` is REQUIRED** in env.json or hook logs are silently
  dropped (the `_finalize` log-collection block is gated on this flag).
- **No checkpoint caching.** `UseComputerRunner.supports_checkpoint_caching()`
  returns False. Don't design tasks that assume cached state. Every reset
  runs all hooks from scratch (cold-start cost ~30s sandbox provision +
  whatever your install takes).
- **`pre_task` launches the app** (the existing cua_world convention applies
  unchanged). Agent tasks are operations inside the running app. Smoke tasks
  have `max_steps: 1` and pre_task does the launching; agent no-ops.
- **`Enter` ≠ `Return`** in macOS apps' form-submit contexts. Use `Enter`
  for "submit URL" in Safari address bar etc. Use `Return` for newlines in
  text fields.
- **Cmd+Space (Spotlight) is disabled** in the base-macos sandbox image.
  Launch apps via Dock click (use visual_grounding for coordinates),
  AppleScript `osascript -e 'tell application "X" to activate'`, or
  `open -a X` via exec_ssh.
- **AppleScript that walks the AX tree fails over SSH** (TCC blocks
  `sshd-keygen-wrapper` from Accessibility). Verifiers should use `pgrep`,
  `lsappinfo`, `defaults read`, file/SQLite reads — NOT `osascript ... tell
  System Events`. The use.computer SDK ships an `ax_helper` for the rare
  case you genuinely need AX (see `12_macos_environments.md`).
- **Safari is sandboxed** — its real prefs live in
  `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/`. Some
  prefs (HomePage) propagate from `defaults write com.apple.Safari`; others
  (`IncludeDevelopMenu`, `ShowFavoritesBar`) don't take effect even with
  cfprefsd flush. Don't design Safari tasks that require the Develop menu
  in the menu bar; agents can use `Cmd+Option+I` shortcut or Terminal curl.

---

## Phase 2: Research the target application

Same as Linux. Specifically for macOS:

- Is the app **available as a .pkg installer**, drag-and-drop `.app`,
  brew cask, or Mac App Store download? Each has different install patterns
  (12_macos_environments.md "Installation Patterns" covers all four).
- Is it **x86_64-only**? On Apple Silicon (the use.computer fleet) you'll
  need to install Rosetta 2 in pre_start (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta
  --agree-to-license`).
- Does it **require Gatekeeper bypass**? Use
  `sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/<App>.app"` after
  install.
- What **state files** does the app use? Look in `~/Library/Application Support/<app>/`,
  `~/Library/Preferences/com.<vendor>.<app>.plist`, `~/Library/Caches/<app>/`,
  app-specific paths. These are your verifier's source of truth.
- Does the app **need Mac-only data formats** (DMG, SDEF, plist, sqlite)?
  Use Python's stdlib `plistlib`, `sqlite3`; for binary plist convert with
  `plutil -convert xml1`.

---

## Phase 3: Create the env

Mirror `benchmarks/cua_world-macos/environments/safari_env/`. The minimum
file set:

```
benchmarks/cua_world-macos/environments/<env_name>/
├── env.json                         # base="macos", runner="use_computer",
│                                    # diagnostics=true, mounts at
│                                    # /Users/lume/workspace/{scripts,tasks},
│                                    # hooks pointing at those paths
├── scripts/
│   ├── install_<app>.sh             # pre_start; install via DMG/.pkg/brew cask
│   └── setup_<app>.sh               # post_start; defaults write, mkdir state dirs
└── tasks/
    └── <task_name>/
        ├── task.json                # env_id matches env.json id
        ├── setup_task.sh            # pre_task; launches the app, polls lsappinfo
        ├── export_result.sh         # post_task; flushes WAL, queries state,
        │                            # writes /tmp/<task>_result.json
        ├── verifier.py              # reads result via env_info["copy_from_env"],
        │                            # ≥3 criteria, strict wrong-target gate
        ├── test_verifier_offline.py # required offline mock tests
        └── README.md                # domain context, schema/data ref, edge cases
```

Steps in order:

1. Copy `safari_env/env.json` as a starting point. Change `id`, `description`,
   `tags`, `category`. Keep `base: "macos"`, `diagnostics: true`. Update
   mount source paths to your new env's `scripts/` and `tasks/` dirs.

2. Write `install_<app>.sh`. Use one of the patterns from
   `12_macos_environments.md` "Installation Patterns". Always include
   Rosetta install on Apple Silicon if the app is x86_64. Always strip
   quarantine attributes after install.

3. Write `setup_<app>.sh`. Configure the app's prefs via `defaults write`
   (and `killall cfprefsd` after), pre-create state directories under
   `~/Library/`, do any one-time configuration that's independent of the
   per-task work.

4. Write a smoke task (`tasks/launch_<app>/`) FIRST. `max_steps: 1`,
   pre_task launches the app + polls `lsappinfo` until the window registers,
   verifier checks `pgrep -x <App>` + `lsappinfo list | grep -i <App>`.
   This validates the env install + launch + verifier scaffolding end-to-end
   with zero agent logic.

5. **chmod +x ALL .sh files immediately after creating them.** The
   permissions are silent killers (Lesson #1 in
   `05_learnings_best_practices.md`).

---

## Phase 4: Test interactively

**You MUST test live** before declaring the env done. Use the
`extras/research/software_as_env/creation_audit/macos_session.py` interactive
driver (or build one with the same shape if you need a different signature).
It maintains a persistent use.computer sandbox across multiple CLI calls.

Workflow:

```bash
# Boot — runs install + setup + pre_task hooks
USE_COMPUTER_API_KEY=$USE_COMPUTER_API_KEY \
USE_COMPUTER_BASE_URL=$USE_COMPUTER_BASE_URL \
python3 extras/research/software_as_env/creation_audit/macos_session.py boot

# Iterate: screenshot → visual_grounding → click/type/key → screenshot
python3 .../macos_session.py screenshot /tmp/s.png
python3 .../macos_session.py ground "Where is the URL bar?" /tmp/s.png
python3 .../macos_session.py click 960 75
python3 .../macos_session.py type "https://github.com/"
python3 .../macos_session.py key Enter
python3 .../macos_session.py screenshot /tmp/s2.png
# … etc

# Finalize: runs post_task + verifier, copies all artifacts
python3 .../macos_session.py finalize --out-dir benchmarks/cua_world-macos/environments/<env_name>/evidence_docs/<task_name>/interactive_pilot
python3 .../macos_session.py destroy
```

The `visual-grounding` MCP server is configured at `/Users/pranjal/Developer/gym-anything2/.mcp.json` for
Claude Code. If you're driving the agent via Codex or another CLI, you can
also import `visual_grounding` directly:

```python
from extras.research.software_as_env.creation_audit.mcp.screenshot_query_mcp import visual_grounding
print(visual_grounding("Where is the Save button?", "/tmp/s.png"))
```

**Eyes-on verification is required.** Look at every screenshot yourself
(don't just check that the screenshot file was written). Read every JSON
artifact end-to-end. Confirm the JSON the agent produced contains
plausible domain content (real values, not just keys). See pattern #35 in
`10_cross_cutting_patterns.md`.

---

## Phase 5: Evidence package

Per `task_creation_notes/04_evidence_documentation.md`, the evidence lives at
`benchmarks/cua_world-macos/environments/<env_name>/evidence_docs/<task_name>/`.

Minimum:

- `<task_name>_screenshot.png` — start-state evidence (what an interactive
  viewer sees when reset returns)
- `<task_name>_evidence.json` — structured metadata (timestamps, prefs
  state, baseline counts, what the export script saw, hook logs)

Strongly recommended for macOS tasks specifically:

- Per-flow subdirs (`do_nothing/`, `wrong_target/`, `happy_path/`,
  `interactive_pilot/`) each with their own screenshots + summary.json +
  hook logs. See `safari_env/evidence_docs/devtools_security_header_audit/`
  for the canonical shape.
- The actual agent output file (e.g. the report JSON the agent wrote),
  copied via `copy_from_env` BEFORE the sandbox is destroyed.

---

## Phase 6: Self-audit before declaring done

Before considering the env complete, check:

- [ ] All offline mock tests pass (`test_verifier_offline.py` covers
      do-nothing, wrong-target, partial, full-correct, plus anti-gaming
      scenarios per `task_creation_notes/14_task_design_antipatterns.md`).
- [ ] At least one live run via `macos_session.py` reached `passed=True` for
      a happy-path trajectory.
- [ ] At least one live run via `macos_session.py` returned `passed=False,
      score=0` for the do-nothing trajectory.
- [ ] Strict wrong-target gate fires (Pattern #2 in
      `task_creation_notes/03_verification_patterns.md`).
- [ ] Pass threshold is strictly > sum of partial-only credit
      (`task_creation_notes/14` Anti-Pattern #4).
- [ ] No `setup_task.sh` `echo` / `print()` leaks ground truth (Anti-Pattern
      #10).
- [ ] Evidence directory exists with screenshots + result JSONs.
- [ ] Description matches difficulty per Anti-Pattern #1.

---

## Phase 7: What NOT to do (macOS pitfalls)

- ❌ Don't use `base: "ubuntu-gnome-systemd_highres"`. Use `base: "macos"`.
- ❌ Don't write `/workspace/...`. Use `/Users/lume/workspace/...`.
- ❌ Don't use `su - ga -c` or `DISPLAY=:1`. Hooks run as `lume`, no DISPLAY.
- ❌ Don't use `xdotool`, `wmctrl`, `scrot`. macOS has no X server.
- ❌ Don't open Spotlight via Cmd+Space. It's broken in the sandbox.
- ❌ Don't write `osascript ... tell System Events ...` and expect it to
  work — TCC denies that path over SSH.
- ❌ Don't design tasks that require Safari's Develop menu in the menu bar.
  It can't be reliably enabled.
- ❌ Don't omit `diagnostics: true` — you'll lose hook logs.
- ❌ Don't try to use checkpoint caching — `use_cache=True` will raise.
- ❌ Don't trust `defaults read` after a `defaults write` until you've
  verified the value also appears in the sandboxed container path
  (`~/Library/Containers/com.<vendor>.<app>/Data/Library/Preferences/`).

---

## Final notes

The reference safari_env was built end-to-end with these patterns; if a
question isn't answered above, grep `safari_env/` for the answer before
inventing a new pattern. If you do invent a new pattern, document it under
`specific_env_notes/<your_env>/notes.md` so the next agent doesn't have to
re-discover it.
